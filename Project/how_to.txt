1. Make a new python file and create a class for your datatype like there is for the json (Make sure you're doing this in your own branch)

2. Create functions for the datatype in this class, first argument of EVERY function must be 'self'

3. Run the program by:
                    ON LINUX:   python3 PII_tool.py -i [filename.extension]
                                eg: python3 PII_tool.py -i users.json

                    ON WINDOWS: PII_tool.py -i [filename.extension]
                                eg: PII_tool.py -i users.json

4. Once you're happy push the changes to your branch and generate a pull request

NOTES
    Make sure your branch is updated to reflect the latest master branch before starting
